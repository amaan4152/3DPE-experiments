# 3DPE-experiments
Experiments of applying various deep learning techniques for 3D pose estimation in Jetson Nano DevKit 4GB embedded system.

## Goal 
Develop a novel 3D pose estimation algorithm in a Jetson Nano DevKit 4GB environment that can achieve better accuracy and similar performance (maybe better, if we are ambitious) to Mediapipe Blazepose on GPU.
